# Problem Statement
Manual inspection of road conditions is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, leading to delays in identifying and repairing damaged roads. The goal is to develop a classification model capable of automatically detecting and categorizing road damage from images (captured through CC cameras,phone,etc.).

# Idea
The Road Damage Detection System revolutionizes infrastructure maintenance by harnessing the power of modern technology. The live feeds from CCTV cameras can be directly fed into the backend/model, to detect the damaged roads. Also through a seamless integration of web and mobile interfaces, users can effortlessly upload images of damaged roads, enabling swift identification and categorization of road damages. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), the system accurately detects and locates various types of road damages, including longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, alligator cracks, and potholes. An intuitive admin dashboard provides administrators with a comprehensive overview of the uploaded road data, empowering them to efficiently manage and visualize the road damages on an interactive map. By streamlining the inspection process and facilitating timely repairs, the Road Damage Detection System ensures safer and well-maintained road networks, ultimately enhancing infrastructure management and road safety for communities worldwide.
