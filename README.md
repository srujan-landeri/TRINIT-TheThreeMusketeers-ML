# Problem Statement
Manual inspection of road conditions is a time-consuming and labor-intensive task, leading to delays in identifying and repairing damaged roads. The goal is to develop a classification model capable of automatically detecting and categorizing road damage from images (captured through CC cameras,phone,etc.).

# Idea
The Road Damage Detection System revolutionizes infrastructure maintenance by harnessing the power of modern technology. The live feeds from CCTV cameras can be directly fed into the backend/model, to detect the damaged roads. Also through a seamless integration of web and mobile interfaces, users can effortlessly upload images of damaged roads, enabling swift identification and categorization of road damages. Leveraging state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, such as YOLO (You Only Look Once), the system accurately detects and locates various types of road damages, including longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, alligator cracks, and potholes. An intuitive admin dashboard provides administrators with a comprehensive overview of the uploaded road data, empowering them to efficiently manage and visualize the road damages on an interactive map. By streamlining the inspection process and facilitating timely repairs, the Road Damage Detection System ensures safer and well-maintained road networks, ultimately enhancing infrastructure management and road safety for communities worldwide.

Let's break down the product into its components: the web application for users to upload photos, the mobile app for the same purpose, and the admin dashboard for managing and visualizing the data.

### Web Application (User Interface)

### Admin Dashboard (Web Interface)

#### Authentication:
- The admin dashboard requires authentication for access to sensitive data and functionalities.
- Only authorized users with administrative privileges can access the admin dashboard.
- Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate admin users securely.

#### Road Data Management:
- The admin dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of all uploaded photos of damaged roads.
- Admins can view, filter, and manage the road data, categorized by the type of damage (e.g., longitudinal crack, transverse crack, pothole).
- The dashboard includes features for searching, sorting, and filtering road data to facilitate efficient management.

#### Filtered Road Images

#### Map Visualization:
- One of the key features of the admin dashboard is the map visualization of the damaged roads.
- The geo data from images will be extracted, so that the exact location of the damaged road can be known.
- Admins can view the damaged roads overlaid on a map, color-coded and labeled according to the type of damage.
- Google Maps API integration is used to render the map and display the road data visually.

### Machine Learning Component (Backend)

#### Object Detection:
- The machine learning component of the system utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection algorithm.
- YOLO is trained to detect and locate various types of road damages, including longitudinal cracks, transverse cracks, alligator cracks, and potholes.
- The machine learning model is trained on a diverse dataset of road images annotated with bounding boxes indicating the location and type of damage.

#### Integration with Web and Mobile Apps:
- Upon user photo upload through the web or mobile app, the images are processed using the YOLO algorithm for road damage detection.
- The detected damages are categorized and stored along with the uploaded photos in Firebase Realtime Database.
- The web and mobile apps retrieve and display the detected damages from the database, providing users with insights into road conditions.
